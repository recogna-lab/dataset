Thank you for being so interested in the tree trunk dataset. This dataset is composed of 801 images created for tasks that comprise the use of deep learning-based approaches for tree trunk segmentation. The images are divided into training, validation, and test sets with a proportion of 70%, 15%, and 15%.

The images are clippings from photographs of trees in the urban environment. Each folder is composed of two subfolders: one containing the RGB images and another containing the binary masks that represent the manual annotation of the region of the tree trunk. All images were resized to a 224x224 resolution.

By downloading the images, you are accepting to cite the following paper in all publications that use this dataset:

**Jodas, D. S., Brazolin, S., Yojo, T., de Lima, R. A., Velasco, G. D. N., Machado, A. R., & Papa, J. P. (2021, October). A Deep Learning-based Approach for Tree Trunk Segmentation. In 2021 34th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) (pp. 370-377). IEEE.**

Also, we would like to ask you to consider the citation of the following paper that proposes a method for detecting trees in images taken from ground-level of the urban environment:
