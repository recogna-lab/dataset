Thank you for being so interested in the tree species dataset. This dataset comprises 727 images created for tree species classification using photographs from the street-view perspective. Moreover, a text file with the label, i.e., the tree species of each image file, is also available in this repository.

By downloading the images, you are accepting to cite the following paper in all publications that use this dataset:

**Jodas, D. S., Passos, L., Velasco, G. D. N., Longo, M. H. C., Machado, A. R., & Papa, J. P. Multiclass Oversampling via Optimum-Path Forest for Tree Species Classification from Street-view Perspectives. In Press (Accepted for presentation at the 2022 35th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI).)**

Please, consider the citation of the following paper that proposes a method for detecting trees in images taken from the street-view perspective of the urban environment:
