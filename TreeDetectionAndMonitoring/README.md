We deeply appreciate your kind interest in the tree detection and monitoring dataset. This dataset includes a series of images designed for object detection tasks and a CSV file with several aspects extracted from urban trees of different species. The image set includes 1,434 images from the street view perspective and a series of XML files containing bounding box locations encompassing the trees in the images. The CSV file provides a set of 42 aspects collected from 2,028 urban trees during fieldwork campaigns in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. In addition, each tree is provided along with its failure probability, i.e., the risk of falling expressed in percentage.

If you wish to use the images and the provided files in your research, you accept to cite the following papers in all publications that use this dataset:

**Jodas, D. S., Yojo, T., Brazolin, S., Velasco, G. D. N., & Papa, J. P. (2022). Detection of Trees on Street-View Images Using a Convolutional Neural Network. *International Journal of Neural Systems*, 32(01), 2150042.**
